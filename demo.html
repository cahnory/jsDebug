		<p>
			This short test page shows all kind of error detected. There are just 3 for the moment:
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>console.log usage</dt>
			<dd>jsDebug: Using console could stop your script in IE</dd>
			<dt>Use of undefined $ var</dt>
			<dd>jsDebug: There is no framework attached to '$'</dd>
			<dt>Use of undefined jQuery var</dt>
			<dd>jsDebug: jQuery is not loaded</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			It's just a draft, it's not very useful as if you think to use this script you may find these errors by yourself. I just made it in order to have a place to put all the little mistakes I encounter while coding. Maybe someday it will be more interestingâ€¦
		</p>
		<p>
			IE users, you should have seen confirm boxes with each errors. For the others, take a look to the console.
